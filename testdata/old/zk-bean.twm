  {title BLACK-EYED BEAN CUTLETS  (A LA KING)}
  {ingredients {label get:}
   {p a can of black eyed beans (1.29 at Joe's Market)}
   {p 1 carrot (washed, not peeled)}
   {p 1/5th of an onion}
   {p 1 garlic clove}
   {p soy sauce}
   {p salt and pepper}
   {p some bread}
   {p curry powder}
   {p a blender}
  }
  {procedure
   {p
    BLENDERIZE peas, carrot, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and a splash of soy 
    sauce until it resembles mush but some resemblence of their former textures 
    still remains. Remove from blender. Wash blender. 
   }
   {p
    BLENDERIZE BREAD WITH CURRY POWDER until you have about a cup or more of fine 
    bread crumbs all turmericky.
   }
   {p
    By hand, mix all the stuff together. You want it to be soft but firm enough to
    stick together reasonably well.
   }
   {p
    By hand, make into hamburger-sized patties. Fry in hot oil until kinda browny 
    and crispy on each side. Don't worry if they fall apart; they still taste 
    good. 
   }
   {p
    Eat those motherfuckers! They're really tasty (not spicy) and filling and 
    nutritious and all that.
   }
  }
  {yield
   {p
    This recipe makes way too much black-eyed mush for one meal, so refridgerate 
    the uncooked portions in a bowl with saran wrap.
   }
  }
 }
 {p I'm eating some right now. With water, even.}

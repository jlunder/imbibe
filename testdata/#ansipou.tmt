One night on #ansi...

<radman> _Cthulu: hey dude do you have POUTINE
<Cthulu> not only do we have it, we even eat it once in a while.  we can get it
         from burger king.
<radman> hey 
<radman> how do you spell poutine
<radman> I'm looking for a poutine recipe on the 'net, something
<Cthulu> radman - "poutine".  Fries, gravy and cheese curds.
<Cthulu> Though cheeze whiz mixed in with the gravy will do in a pinch 8\)
<radman:> _Cthulu: UGH!
<Cthulu> This is more of a quebec thing than a canada one... I only know
         about it 'cause I was in french immersion.
<tna> cthulu: poutine rules.
<radman> poutine is spelled poutine?
<Cthulu> man - hey, when I cross the border and all of a sudden start seeing
         "fried pig rind" in convenience stores, I don't feel too appetized
         either 8\)
<Cthulu> I wonder if you find a hair in them once in a while.
<tna> cthulu: no you dont
<Cthulu> poutine kicks ass.
<Cthulu> over american fast food, at least 8\)
<radman> ahahahahha
<radman> I dont eat pig rinds     
<Cthulu> and I rarely eat poutine 8\)
<radman> I eat PHO
<radman> PHO NOODUL
<Cthulu> that's amazing..
<Cthulu> "POKE NOODOH" is a catchphrase up here...
<radman> 
<radman> A Traditional Quebecois Sensation
<radman> 
<radman> Recipe
<radman> 
<radman> Take one bowl of french fries, the greasier the better. Add a couple
<radman> of tablespoons of cheddar cheese curds. Then smother
<radman> with hot turkey gravy. 
<radman> Serving Suggestion
<radman> Its perfectly respectable to serve it alone as a meal, however most
<radman> truck drivers would want a couple of dogs on the side, and
<radman> maybe a can of coke to wash it down with. 
<radman> AHHH, POUTINE       

<radman> Eating Suggestion
<radman> Each fry is to be held with a fork and lovingly caressed. Dip it in
<radman> some sauce, hold it up, examine it closely, let the sauce drip
<radman> off. Admire it for what it is. 
<radman> Chew it slowly to enjoy the flavour. Mix it up a bit, perhaps a
<radman> couple of fries, then a curd. Or have fun: have 2 or 3 curds in a
<radman> row. Poutine is supposed to be a fun meal.
<radman> However, if its cold, then consume it quickly. Dont wait for the
<radman> grease to congeal.
<radman> 
<radman> congealed grease, there's nothing worse!
<Cthulu> yeah, pigskin is worse 8\)
<radman> hahahahha
<tna> radman: msg me your address, i'll send you an envelop of premixed
      poutine sauce.. the kinda things you just need to add water :\)
<radman> tna: really?  there is such a thing?  A poutine gravy powder?
<radman> tna: is it just turkey gravey? 
<tna> no, its really a poutine sauce.. i'll try to get like, the best around..
      tho its not as good as the sauce you get to eat in other restaurants. :\)
<radman> so what qualifies as a "cheese curd" might I ask
<Cthulu> radman - it's what you make cheese out of.  milk ages and separates
         into curds and whey.  (remember little miss muffet?
<radman> _Cthulu: yea I've ALWAYS wondered wtf curds and whey were
<Cthulu> radman - drive up to oregon / washington and visit tilamook.
<Cthulu> it's cheese country 8\)
<Cthulu> I should warn you all that I'm logging and capturing this for the
         next kithe cookbook 8\)
<radman> tna: I had something called italian poutine, they substituted
         the gravey with marinara
<radman> heh
<radman> wacky I tell you   
<radman> Now I'm hungry
<radman> for some congealed poutine
<tna> radman: yeah, the italian poutine we have here is made with like,
      spaghetti (sp) sauce.       
<radman> Generic Poutine: http://web.soi.city.ac.uk/pgg/article/Poutine
<Quip> poutine is awesome
<Quip> fuck that bullshit new york fries shit. burger king poutine rules
       all.
<radman> I agree with Malcolm X.  If a Poutine shop were to be opened
         here, it would make millions.        
<Cthulu> when shoten comes up...
<Cthulu> poutine city, man.
<Cthulu> we had it last time...
<radman> How could a country like the U.S. not go hog wild for three
  fatty foods rolled into one snack.
<Cthulu> radman - you'd have to give it a less ethnic name...
<Cthulu> the US people think that french sounds snobbish.
<Cthulu> you'll have to call them like "french nachos" or something.
<creator_> hehe   
<Cthulu> nacho-fries.
<radman> _Cthulu: ahahah nacho fries

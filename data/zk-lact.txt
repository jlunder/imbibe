E> Do any of those drugs--like Lactaid--help at all?

They just provide lactase flora to ease the process of digestion.  All human 
beings will become lactose intolerant if they don't eat dairy for a few
weeks, because the lactase we have after being weaned is not naturally
there. It has to grow.  

Yogourt, which has lactase in it, can help reestablish the flora, and indeed 
it is one of the easiest dairy products to digest.

Dairy allergies are a completely different matter -- and more serious.

There's a funny story from the annals of history -- according to Indian and
Norse legends, when the Vikings came over to the new world around 1000 ad,
they tried to make friends with the Native people on the east coast.  They
gave them milk, something that was a large part of the Norse diet. The
Indians, who had never drank animal milk before, became violently ill and
were convinced the Norsemen had poisoned them.  So, they attacked the
Vikings and drove them back to the sea.

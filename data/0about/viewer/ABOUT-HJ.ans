[0m[1;30mAh youth.[0m

If you subscribe to the idea -- as I generally do -- that adulthood doesn't
really start until around[1;36m age 25[0m, then I was not an adult yet when we embarked
on this rather roundabout journey, though I was certainly old enough to be
held responsible. Well, I am definitely an adult now, this [1;36myear of our lord
2025[0m, and what is adulthood about if not perpetually atoning for your past
indiscretions? And maybe producing a new generation of indiscrete mistake-
makers along the way. I don't think this is a debt we're meant to fully pay
off.

This is not my first involvement with this project. I don't know that I was
the only coder [35mCthulu[37m tapped to work on it, but at the time I did work on it,
I wrote a short editorial making various excuses for my own slow progress.
Before I subject you to that litany of procrastination (and [35mCthulu[37m's response
to the debacle), I should describe the circumstances from my side, wherein I
came to finally call this project done.

If you keep reading to the end (it's a longish walk), I will also eventually
provide the banana bread recipe I used to make with my child, which he has
taken on baking entirely himself, now that he's a hungry teenager. It's based
on a [1;33mbanana muffin recipe[0m that I learned indirectly from (if I recall
correctly) [36mEtana[37m's mother, and my first attempt at baking it dates back to
around the time Imbibe was originally planned. It closes one or two circles
neatly, as does this whole emag release.


In the summer of [1;36m2024[0m, I was regularly accompanying my child to a [31mD&D[37m group
held at a local public place. By chance, significantly -- though I'm sure
various social connections kept that chance nontrivial -- [35mthe mighty Cthulu[37m
was also not infrequently accompanying his child to the same group. As happens
when parents are in such situations, we ended up conversing about shared
interests to stave off the boredom of waiting for someone else's game to
finish. With what I perceived to be a total lack of expectation, [35mCthulu[37m
mentioned that he had recently re-committed to finishing Imbibe, framing it in
terms of the satisfaction of finally checking everything off from his pre-
millennial to-do list.

This piqued my interest; I am firmly at the mid-life stage where dads from my
youth would start working on classic car projects from their youth, so perhaps
it was inevitable that I should pick up some sort of retrocoding project. When
I first lost the plot, my recollection is that I had grown the scope of my
intent to essentially an embedded microkernel and full TUI windowing system.

[33mAh, youth.[37m

So I always had a [1;30msmall[0m pang of guilt that scope creep and an inability to
focus on the actual goal of release had in some way resulted in the project
fizzling.

What irony, then! That in describing his experience of the project's demise,
[35mCthulu[37m placed the blame on [35mhimself[37m for being overwhelmed by the instructions
I'd given him for formatting the content! I suppose we both bear some
responsibility. I have definitely done a bit more work in preparing the
menus and integrating the articles than I had originally planned, but well, I
did tools work in games for many years and -- if I'm honest --[1m most artists[0m
[1mand designers, even the highly motivated and productive ones, were similarly[0m
[1mreluctant to deal with my janky tools[0m. (If only they knew just how much
jankier that pipeline could have been! [1mOy![0m)

The reality is I was [1mnever more than 25% of the way through the project[0m as a
whole, at least not if you count what you see now as the real goal. I did have
a solid start! It's possible I would have compromised more at the time and
released a more reasonable product, should [35mCthulu[37m have been more prompt in
delivering an edited set of articles. We will never know.

In any event, between my own improved experience and the tremendous advances
in programming languages, I was able to make this current iteration far, far
less janky. Although [1mit did take somewhat longer[0m than I originally intended --
it's the [1;36mendest end of February[0m now and I was thinking to get it ready last
[1;36mOctober[0m -- I daresay I'm almost proud of the result, even though most of what
is captured in the articles is really teenage-to-young-adult [1;35mridiculousness[0m,
inside jokes from a social group that's thoroughly atomized now. Maybe the
result is of [36mhistorical[37m or [33manthropological[37m interest to you; or maybe you're
one of [1mour children[0m, wanting to know more about mom or dad's barely fathomable
youth; maybe you're [1;30mof a certain age[0m, and want to [32mwallow in nostalgia [37mfor [1;36ma
minute[0m; or maybe you're someone else from our life, a student perhaps, curious
about our [1;35mless professional[0m [1;36mpast[0m. In that latter case, I'd say 1. that's some
pretty dedicated sleuthing, and 2. [1mI hope you're not too horrified[0m.

Now, as promised, the editorial I wrote when I thought I was on the cusp of
release. Is there any reason to include it? I don't know, but here it is! It's
the only contemporaneous writing of mine in the whole emag, because although I
was active on the message boards [35mCthulu[37m scavenged content from for the
articles, it would seem I wasn't talking about food.

(I find a timeline that runs for [1;36m2 years[0m then disappears for [1;36m25[0m, amusing. And
please, try to read this mostly as self-deprecating hamming...)

imbibe e-mag viewer:

the source code for imbibe weighs ~100k, which is ~5000 lines of C++ for me
(85 or so typewritten pages), making it the largest single project I've ever
completed. for better or worse, that's not that big on the scale of things.
still. I'm a little proud.

my development tools (for DOS) are: Watcom C++ 10.6, Tran's PMODE/W, and edit.
the Watcom remote debugger for Windows is the bomb. edit is the tool of satan.

therefore I am satan. worship me.

imbibe is absurdly overdesigned. I hope to exploit that later by writing lots
of e-mag viewers with really weird features and graphical easter-eggs: so if
you have an idea for an e-mag and want a viewer coded, I would be happy to
oblige. send mail to [1;34mxxxxxxxxxx@xxxxxxx.com[0m. it might take me a week or two to

[[35mCthulu[37m [1;30mpicks up the trail, September 2022:[0m]

Of course, this document is what we might consider an alternate history,
since upon its final release this magazine distinctly is surely not tapping
any of the technology [1;34mJoe [0mcooked up for its use, no trace of which must
remain some 24 years later.  (School just started, and my family is sharing a
carpooling arrangement with Joe's for getting our kids to class and back, so
even though this has all been dormant longer than our lifespan to date back
when it was a going concern, the slim thread of history continues running
through our respective projects.)

While wading around knee-deep in this pile of captures, like the[1m Fellowship[0m of
the Ring reconstructing the fall of [33mKhazad-dï¿½m[37m, trying to determine
conclusively just what the heck went wrong after getting 99% of the way
there... leaving us collectively languishing in development hell for,
charitably, a couple of decades -- I think I cracked the code.  Or is it
that the code cracked me?  Literally, it's [1;36m1998[0m [1;34mHacker Joe's[0m homebrew markup
language intended for beautifying the dozens of articles reserved for this
production.  I must have taken one look at it and gone "Manually implement my
own proprietary replacement for the (national) standard provided by ANSI?
Yeah, I'll definitely prioritise doing that... when [1;35mpigs[0m fly!"  Without any
intention to shame or scold Joe for his rough but robust solution to my nutty
problem, here you go, below -- the sample he provided that almost certainly
halted me in my tracks:

        this is an example of some formatted, marked up text.
        {this is an aside}

        \c15{[1mthis text is bright white[0m}
        \c15,1{[1;44mthis text is bright white on blue[0m}
        \c,7{[1;47mthis text has a gray background[0m}
        \db,15

        \p15,1{there is a 15% probability that this text will be[34m blue[37m}

In retrospect, it's not so impossible to work with, but history has
demonstrated that I can be pretty thoroughly derailed by even small
obstacles.  Now we know!  Now in its place instead of one user-unfriendly
solution I have wound up working with an entirely different user-unfriendly
solution of much lesser flexibility, with no tech support.  [1;31mNice work, bozo!
[0m
[[35mCthulu[1;30m resumes the trail in mid-2024:[0m]

OK, well, I have many different projects competing for my attention.  This is
definitely the most longstanding of them, but sometimes forward progress gets
blocked for a long time for a good reason -- because overcoming the obstacles
in your path is genuinely challenging!

I have to roll back a couple of bold proclamations made in 2022: in fact, we
did wind up putting this together using Joe's quarter-century-old code.  (It's
like FORTRAN programmers coming out of retirement to save mainframes and the
banking industry during [1mY2K[0m, only the stakes are a little lower.)  When I got
back in touch with Joe, he was like "oh yes, I definitely bit off a bit too
much with that project, I was trying to make the emag into a multi-threaded
operating system", so I don't feel too bad about being thrown clear by the
explosive scope creep at that time.

The entirely different user-unfriendly solution?  Too user-unfriendly, it
turns out.  (I had a scheme to hoover out the content from an issue of [1;33mEerie[0m's
ANSI review e-mag [36mUndergrown[37m and replace its assets with ours, a trick I know
is theoretically possible because [1;31mHappyfish[0m did it once for a [1;33mBlender [0mon the
topics of [1mNINJA[0m / [1mKUNG FU[0m / [1mSWEATSHOP[0m.)

The carpooling arrangement?  Wasn't the right fit for that moment in time,
alas.  But as this magazine demonstrates, it's never too late, so keep your
options open and maybe someday these kids will be commuting to work together
through the post-apocalyptic hellscape of 2049.

[1;30m-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, to correct the technical record:

Imbibe, the C++ source code, is currently about 9200 lines and ~250kB that
aren't just BS. The repository contains a header with a character font that
doubles both of those figures, but I didn't really write it and it's not even
compiled into the DOS .EXE, just the OpenGL version. There's also about 4100
lines and ~135kB of Python code to deal with building the data files.

A tiny amount of the original code I referenced does persist. At first I
figured I would finish it according to the original design, but as always with
these things, I Had Better Ideas The Second Time Round (technically the third
or fourth I suppose).

This version doesn't use PMODE/W, although that is a delightful bit of kit; at
this point it felt more interesting to go really retro and aim for a 286 min
spec which practically speaking meant real mode. I get to use flat address
spaces ALL the time now! BORING. I'm still using OpenWatcom though, descended
from good ol' Watcom C++!

It's not super well optimized, and I didn't even try to make the data load
incrementally, so you'll need a fast 286 -- it felt okay but not amazing at
16MHz which really is pretty fast for a 286. so I don't actually feel that
great calling a 286 min spec, but it does run.

(What a [36mwindbag[37m this guy is! [1mGet it over with![0m)

Fine, fine, that's more than enough for you to know. There's some really
interesting (to me) detail in the way the ANSI is compressed, but if you're
that kind of gearhead go find the git repository, I guess! It's public.
For now.

1998 June:

The Mighty Cthulu: "hey joe, can I take advantage of your hax0rly skillz to
                    produce an 3l33te e-mag called imbibe, all about food?"
The 313370 hAx0R j03: "w0w! that sounds liK3 a r3et el33t ide4! g3t Me soME
                       aRticlez aNd I'll get hax0ring!"

1998 August:

The 31ee70 haXoR J03: "h3y r0wan, wHEre arE th3 artic1es j00 prOMiseD me?"

[It's a valid question: the latest timestamp on the vast majority of these 
articles is March 21, 1998, well before Joe was shaking me down.  What was I 
up to, having a breakdown?]  [Oh wait, M-9808 -- I *was* having a breakdown!]

1998 October:

The 3lit3 hAx0R j03: "ROWAN, th33 ARTICLEZ?"

1998 December:

The 313370 HAx0r Joe: "ROWAN YOU HOOR! I'VE BEEN ON YOUR ASS ABOUT THOSE
                       ARTICLES FOR MONTHS NOW! GET ME THOSE ARTICLES!"

1999 March:

The Mighty Cthulu: "Here are the articles 8)"
The 313370 hAx0R j03: "s0rRy. I w4it3d 8 m0nths, and now I've ins7a113d
                       leenooks like a g00d little hax0r. um, TS 4 n0w, er..
                       <sh33pi5H lo0k>"

1999 September:

The 31337 hAX0R j00: "y33h4w I bought a 1337 l4PT0P for sch00L! it onLy runz
                      LOSED0ZE, which I have to run anyh0w 4 skewl."

1999 December 19 (sunday) ~10h:

The 37331 hAck3R j03: "I'm bored. I think I'll code imbibe."


fortunately, the articles were written (thanks forever to my pack-rat nature)
onto a CD-R backup of one of my hard drives before The Mighty Cthulu's hard
drive got exploded by The Evil Laughing Linux Hax0r. I was able to get to 
work straight away.

anyway, you can see that this project has been underway for over a year now.
[ha ha ha ha ha] that means it must be really good, right?


right?

imbibe e-mag viewer:

the source code for imbibe weigh[ed] ~100k, which is ~5000 lines of C++ for me
(85 or so typewritten pages), making it the largest single project I'[d] ever
completed. for better or worse, that's not that big on the scale of things.
still. I [was] a little proud.

my development tools (for DOS) [were]: Watcom C++ 10.6, Tran's PMODE/W, and 
edit.  the Watcom remote debugger for Windows is the bomb. edit is the tool 
of satan.

therefore I am satan. worship me.

imbibe is absurdly overdesigned. I hope[d] to exploit that later by writing
lots of e-mag viewers with really weird features and graphical easter-eggs:
so if you [had] an idea for an e-mag and want[ed] a viewer coded, I would
[have been] happy to oblige. send mail to [a very old address]. it might take
me a week or two to respond, but I will respond [but not to mail sent to that
long dormant address], so be patient.


greets and dedications are for losers who know other people.

[Cthulu picks up the trail, September 2022:]

Of course, this document is what we might consider an alternate history, 
since upon its final release this magazine distinctly is not tapping any of 
the technology Joe cooked up for its use, no trace of which remains some 24 
years later.  (School just started, and my family is sharing a carpooling 
arrangement with Joe's for getting our kids to class and back, so even though 
this has all been dormant longer than our lifespan to date back when it was a 
going concern, the slim thread of history continues running through our 
respective projects.)

While wading around knee-deep in this pile of captures, like the Fellowship of
the Ring reconstructing the fall of Khazad-d√ªm, trying to determine 
conclusively just what the heck went wrong after getting 99% of the way 
there... leaving us collectively languishing in development hell for, 
charitably, a couple of decades -- I think I cracked the code.  Or is it 
that the code cracked me?  Literally, it's 1998 Hacker Joe's homebrew markup
language intended for beautifying the dozens of articles reserved for this 
production.  I must have taken one look at it and gone "Manually implement my 
own proprietary replacement for the (national) standard provided by ANSI?  
Yeah, I'll definitely prioritise doing that... when pigs fly!"  Without any 
intention to shame or scold Joe for his rough but robust solution to my nutty 
problem, here you go, below -- the sample he provided that almost certainly 
ground me to a halt:

        this is an example of some formatted, marked up text.
        {this is an aside}

        \c15{this text is bright white}
        \c15,1{this text is bright white on blue}
        \c,7{this text has a gray background}
        \db,15
        \cb{this text is bright white (Bold)}
        \p15,1{there is a 15% probability that this text will be blue}

In retrospect, it's not so impossible to work with, but history has
demonstrated that I can be pretty thoroughly derailed by even small 
obstacles.  Now we know!  Now in its place instead of one user-unfriendly 
solution I have wound up working with an entirely different user-unfriendly 
solution of much lesser flexibility, with no tech support.  Nice work, bozo!

[Cthulu resumes the trail in mid-2024:]

OK, well, I have many different projects competing for my attention.  This is
definitely the most longstanding of them, but sometimes forward progress gets
blocked for a long time for a good reason -- because overcoming the obstacles
in your path is genuinely challenging!

I have to roll back a couple of bold proclamations made in 2022: in fact, we 
did wind up putting this together using Joe's quarter-century-old code.  (It's
like FORTRAN programmers coming out of retirement to save mainframes and the
banking industry during Y2K, only the stakes are a little lower.)  When I got
back in touch with Joe, he was like "oh yes, I definitely bit off a bit too
much with that project, I was trying to make the emag into a multi-threaded
operating system", so I don't feel too bad about being thrown clear by the 
explosive scope creep at that time.

The entirely different user-unfriendly solution?  Too user-unfriendly, it
turns out.  (I had a scheme to hoover out the content from an issue of Eerie's
ANSI review e-mag Undergrown and replace its assets with ours, a trick I know 
is theoretically possible because Happyfish did it once for a Blender on the
topics of NINJA / KUNG FU / SWEATSHOP.)

The carpooling arrangement?  Wasn't the right fit for that moment in time,
alas.  But as this magazine demonstrates, it's never too late, so keep your
options open and maybe someday these kids will be commuting to work together
through the post-apocalyptic hellscape of 2049.

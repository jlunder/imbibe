Before we start, I'll just make a comment about the way the recipes are
listed.  Recipes with an asterisk (*) in front of their names denote vegan-
friendly status and should contain no dairy or meat products.  (Borderline
ingredients like peanut butter have been accounted for and disqualify some
recipes.)  There may remain a few ingredients which might not satisfy a 
strict Buddhist (honey, for instance) or Hare Krsna (they don't like those 
darned onions) but everything marked with an asterisk is guaranteed not to 
make baby Jesus cry.

It should also be noted that some recipes that appear in the non-vegetarian
section contain meat given their ingredients listings but in many cases can
easily be adapted to be karma-free for vegetarians and even vegans.

Now line up to the starting line and start your stomachs, because we're about
to begin!

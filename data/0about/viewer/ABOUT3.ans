Hello, here is [35mCthulu[37m again, now in the year 2022 [[1;30mwell no,[0m 2024 [1;30mactually[0m]
[[1;30mOK, now early [0m2025], from which point on some of this stuff may actually get
read a litle for the first time this century.  OK, so none of the clarifying
text thus far really goes any distance toward explaining ... well, a number
of questions pertaining to this release.  Why did we go to the work of
collecting a complete e-mag's worth of articles in 1998 and then not release
it?  Why recipes?  Why go to the work of actually releasing this vaporware
e-mag after more than a quarter-century, confusing and dismaying both
contemporary viewers and historical authors?  [1;36mWhat the absolute fuck, man?
[0m
Mist Classic was an artpack at war with an e-mag.  Having our debut artpack
include our infofiles packaged as an executable -- the "[1mKithe[0m" electronic
magazine -- was a prestigious flourish, but it was also a profound curse.  In
place of staid NFO files, we wanted to release a new issue with every
artpack, and we wanted to release an artpack every month.  (We often weren't
capable of maintaining an artpack release pace anything remotely like that,
but that's a whole different story of underdelivering for another time.)  All
you need to generate a newsletter is an ANSI editor and a lamer with a gift
for gab, but e-mag production requires greater infrastructure: not only
article authors but interface artists, soundtrack composers, and above all --
programmers.  Is a teenaged programmer going to cook up an e-mag engine
sufficiently robust for future use by amateurs in their parent's basement?
No, they're going to come up with jury-rigged routines strung together in the
most tenuous fashion possible, shipping it the moment it works reliably
(without really understanding why), and maybe resolving to fix and improve
the engine next time around... but then will they actually effect the repairs
and refactoring the situation calls for?  Or will they instead stop calling
in to the WHQ, and perhaps quietly slink off to university?  Very possibly.
I can't blame them -- an ongoing work in progress is a commitment teenaged
nerds don't need (they already ARE all the ongoing work in progress they
need!) and it's not reasonable to expect them to keep it up.  So one person
shoulders the entire burden, then disappears, and some other aspiring
programmer reinvents the wheel.  Then they disappear, and so forth and so on.

We released a lot more artpacks than e-mags, but as our e-mags had been
charged with the sacred responsibiity of infofiles, we felt that in order to
justify themselves they had to actually accurately reflect everything you had
missed since the last issue, which was often months or in some cases years
earlier.  (We come at you, again, currently in the year 202[5], with our most
recent previous e-mag release having taken place [28 years] prior in 1997.
28 years before that release, there was no such thing as a personal
computer!  Rest assured, we have left a great deal of water under the
bridge.)  So we would just capture and bottle up BBS message posts and IRC
chat logs as they came up, if they were deemed pertinent to notable group
affairs (and what could be more pertinent than "get to know the personalities
in our community of artists"?)  Capturing them was easy.  Then, when the next
rising programmer unwittingly volunteered to provide an outlet for the
dammed-up content, we'd have dozens of articles to overwhelm them with,
ensuring that they'd never volunteer for a successive tour.

This has been the story of [1mKithe[0m so far, but this e-mag is no Kithe.  (It
inherits the legacy of Kithe #11, the Kithe Cookbook, which planted this seed
no one ever expected to come to fruition.)  It was 1996 and we could smell
the change in the weather: [1;34mWindows '95[0m had dropped the previous year and
MS-DOS was a dead man walking.  In 1996 what was your favorite Windows
terminal program and ANSI art editor?  Trick question!  There were no
worthwhile applications for those undertakings on that platform, but you
would gladly throw them under the bus for a taste of what [1;36mNetscape [0mwas
offering up.  So with the awareness that with every passing day we were
approaching the end of the CLI BBS era, we got a little trigger-happy about
bottling up the good stuff as we caught it floating by -- not just to
document the era and enshrine the milieu, but in celebration of the social
context passing before our eyes, friends we knew we would soon lose track of
and never encounter again, often never having even known each others' real
names.  Smother it allll in [1;33mamber[0m!  What a magnificent time capsule we shall
have!

We found our local BBS community rather productive not just in discussion of
artscene matters, but also in sharing vivid reports of fascinating dream
imagery ... and talking about food.  (As the old adage has it, anyone who
eats three meals a day will understand why cookbooks outsell sex manuals
three to one.)  [[1;30mOh dang, looking over the articles, I already made that
reference in here 2[8] years ago!  Well, the quip must really be one for the
ages now![0m]  Kithe #14 featured significant sub-menus devoted to both topics
[dreams and food, that is], and we felt that they might be profitably spun
off into parallel dedicated e-mags with a sharper focus on their specific
themes.  This was to be the first spin-off!  But 1998 was... rather full of
distractions.  For the first time ever, with my undivided focus at the helm,
we were succeeding with a monthly release schedule!  We had projects creeping
in all directions simultaneously, from[36m music CDs[37m to [1;31mcomic books[0m -- surely one
of them was liable to pop!  Most excitingly we were striving to bridge the
fading BBS world with the burgeoning one of the early Web.  As Gramsci noted:
"[1;36mThe old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the
time of monsters![0m"  That effort was M-9808, and ... well, [31mthe monsters got
us[37m.

In its death struggles, for March '99 Mist lashed out to the artscene with an
ultimatum -- the rest of the scene similarly unmoored, a cadre of BBS
advertisers with no BBSes remaining to advertise, I had a little too much
Blender on the brain and challenged artscene crews to pull together and
create art on a common theme -- but a serious one this time, that of [31mHunger[37m.
No one thought this was a good idea (Dieznyik joked about scrollers of [36mSpawn
[37mlooking sadly at an empty plate, a scene I doodled terribly in ANSI for the
6th The Project... King Arthur and I interpreted the topic musically in
tracker tunes that eventually manifested a little "sooner" in the MIST2000
artpack collection now [ten] years ago) but I thought that it would provide a
highly synergistic context in which to drop this e-mag.  Yet still no one
made Hungry art and this e-mag stubbornly refused to release, so you kind of
have to take my word for it.

When things ground to a halt, an impressive quantity of unfinished Mist
business [32msank to the[36m bottom of the [34msea [37mwith me, notably including this
e-mag.  (After this nourishing business is finally resolved, I think our only
major outstanding release of never-released work from the 20th century will
be the Onyx tracker music collection, and I should be able to get that
settled in short order [[1;30myes and no, I actually managed to get that dealt with
at the start of 2024!  last man standing here[0m], finally facing my first day
in some 2[8] years without a nagging bother in the back of my head that I've
got something significant long past due on my desk.)  [That at least hasn't
changed, my entire life is a something significant long past due!]  As the
light at the end of the tunnel grew [1;30mdimmer and dimmer[0m, a real possibility
remained that this mag at least might squeeze its way out of the collapsing
entropy vortex in '99 or 2000 but in the end no trace of it escaped the
gravitational pull of my black hole and it quietly carried on into the 2000s
only as a faint memory in my head, albeit a well-documented one in a folder
on my hard drive.

[1mMist[0m of course had a reunion in 2014, made it annual in 2015 and 2016, and
fell forward into a regular release schedule since then, and nearly all of
the unfinished business that was straightforward to deal with was dealt
with.  This required [... and here the 2022 version of the infofile trailed
off and was never completed.  How was I going to finish that sentence?  I'm
going to guess something along the lines of: "This [e-mag] required quite a
bit more polish and coordination that cumulatively shuffled the undertaking
right out of the "straightforward to deal with" file and somewhere down the
hall, ideally in another office entirely."]  But now, to rather assertively
slap a bow on it, if you are reading this we must have somehow succeeded at
rescuing it from development hell more severe than that of[1;33m Duke Nukem
Forever[0m.  (And what recipes would HE suggest?  No, let me not digress any
further, this production just might see release if only I can stop writing!)

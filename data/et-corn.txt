Of interest to vegetarian-type people.. although not vegan, since it does have
milk and cheese. I've used this recipe many times because it's very
filling--not to mention warming on these chilly January nights--and, take
note to those living on their own, it freezes beautifully..  sometimes I
wonder if it takes better after it's been frozen and reheated in the
microwave.

MEXICAN CORN CHOWDER
Preparation Time: 5 minutes       Cooking time: 15-20 minutes

    1 medium onion
    2 medium celery stalks
    2 tablespoons corn oil
  1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
    1 tablespoon flour
    1 15oz can creamed corn
  1/2 4oz can dized green chilies, drained 
         (I'm not a real fan of chilies, so I use black olives)
    2 cups milk
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  1/4 teaspoon black pepper
    1 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese
      Handful tortilla chips, whole or broken (optional)

    Peel and finely chop the onion. Wash the celery stalks, trim and discard 
the ends and cut the stalks into 1/4-inch slices.
    Heat the oil in a medium-size pot over medium heat. Add the onion and 
celery and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the 
vegetables begin to soften.
    Add the cumin and flour and stir carefully until both are fully absorbed 
into the onion/celery mixture. Add the corn, chilies, milk, salt and black 
pepper and stir toroughly.
    Cook, uncovered, over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, for 8 to 10 
minutes, or until soup thickens. Stir in the cheese and cook for another 1 to 
2 minutes, or until the cheese melts and the soup is hot but not boiling--(Mom
Tip: If the soup is too thick, add an extra 1/2 cup milk or water. When 
reheating, bring soup just to a boil and serve). Ladle into bowls, sprinkle on
a few tortilla chips, if you like, to provide crunch and serve.

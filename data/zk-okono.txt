Eat!!! (er.. omit meat parts)    

Recipe for two (2 pancakes): 

Okonomi-yaki means "as you like it", and an okonomi-yaki is a 
pancake filled with whatever you choose. Provided you have
eggs and flour, the dish can be completed with almost any other 
ingredient you have on hand. 

1. Break 2 eggs and mix in a bowl with 2/3 cup of soup stock or 
water. Sprinkle in 1 cup of weak flour (my note: probably
means regular flour or something that doesn't thicken as much as 
cornstarch) and beat until lumps disappear. 

2. Cut 1/6 of a cabbage into fine strips, thinly slice 60 gm of 
pork, and dice 1/2 an onion. Red pickled ginger, sliced squid,
and other ingredients may also be used. 

3. Add the contents of (2) to (1), stir with chopsticks, and then 
pour mixture slowly out onto an oiled griddle or hot plate.
When underside is brown, flip pancake and cook until done. 

4.Divide into slices with spatula and season with Worcestershire 
sauce, nori (dried seaweed) flakes, bonito flakes, or your
favorite spices. 

================================================================

The following is a restaurant type mixture for about 10 people. 

Basic Ingredients 

10 chicken eggs
2 quail eggs
5 cups of wheat or 6 cups of rice flour
3.5 cups of Awase Miso 

Additional ingredients 

Thin pork slices
Thin beef slices
Shrimp, shelled, deveined and filleted.
Red pickled ginger
Wasabi
Sesame oil
Daikon, grated finely
Thinly sliced Shitaki Mushrooms
or any other flavourings as long as they are thinly sliced. 

Break the eggs in a bowl and mix well. Add Awase Miso to the 
eggs and mix well. Do this slowly and beat so that the mixture
is without lumps. 

Heat a griddle or hot plate to about 350 degrees Fahrenheit and 
oil. Stir mixture just before you pour it out on the hot plate.
Allow to start cooking, and add any ingredients that you would 
like to the mixture that is on the griddle. 

Wait until the bottom is browned and flip over to cook the top. 

Flip back over and onto a plate.
Garnish with bonito, nori, or some wasabi. 

Serve.

1.Break 2 eggs and mix in bowl with 2/3 cup of dashi (or soup 
stock) or water. Sprinkle in 1 cup of weak flour and beat
until lumps disappear. 

2.Cut 1/6 of a head of cabbage into ~1cm-square pieces and mix 
with 60g of thinly sliced pork. Add a 1/2 of an onion,
diced. Tsukuri-ika (sliced squid) or sakura-ebi (dried shrimp) 
may be used instead of pork. Other ingredients like
beni-shouga (red pickled ginger) or vegetables may also be added. 

3.Add the contents of [2] to [1], stir, and then pour mixture on 
hot plate. Some people at this point also add a small packet
of yaki-soba (fried buckwheat noodles) and a raw egg in the center. 
This concoction will form a pile on your hot plate.
Don't be alarmed; it is meant to taste wonderful, not look elegant. 
 
4.When underside is brown, flip pancake and cook until done. 

5.Divide into slices and season with Worcestershire sauce, nori 
(dried seaweed) flakes, katsuo-bushi (bonito flakes),
Kewpie (?) mayonnaise (american is not as good) or your favorite 
spices.

Okonomiyaki Recipe for One: 

Ingredients:

     45 grams of chicken breast 
     1/2 cup of flour 
     a handful of various greens 
     1/3 cup of water 
     1/4 of a medium onion 
     1 egg 
     1 tablespoon of stir fry oil 
     soy sauce 
     ground ginger, celery salt, nutmeg, and dried sweet basil

Instructions: 

   1.Take out a big bowl. Put flour in bowl. Add in water and egg 
(make sure you crack egg first and do not put eggshell into
batter. Dispose of eggshell.) *Since you are not capable of using 
a blender, You can't! You might hurt yourself!, you must stir with 
a wooden spoon.* Stir until batter is smooth, and *do not splatter 
batter everywhere.* *CAREFULLY*, use a knife to dice onion and chop 
vegetables. *And remember to watch that you don't cut yourself!* 
Add onion and vegetable to batter. Stir. Add in a dash of spices. 
*Yeah! You made it through step 1! You aren't as dumb and clumsy as
you seem!* 


   2.Put oil into pan. Place pan on stove. Turn stove onto high 
heat. *Don't burn yourself!* Cut chicken into thin, one inch
strips. *The knife is really sharp, so make sure when you cut the 
meat that your fingers aren't near the blade!* Allow oil
to heat. *It is hot, and you can get burned if it gets onto your 
skin, use caution!* Place chicken into pan and cook until
meat is well done. *Keep up the good work! I think you just may 
be almost as smart as my pet chimpanzee!* 

   3.Add product of step 1 to batter from step 2. Pour batter into 
pan. *Don't spill any...* You may flip the okonamiyaki
when the underside is a light golden brown. *I SAID _LIGHT BROWN_, 
NOT CHARCOAL BLACK!* Cook the otherside until done. 
   
4.Take cooked okonamiyaki out of pan and put onto plate. Divide 
it into slices. *SLICES, _NOT_ crumbs!* Pour on a small amount of 
soy sauce. *You better not screw up and put on too much...* Eat 
and enjoy!

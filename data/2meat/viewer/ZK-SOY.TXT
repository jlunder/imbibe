Just kidding!

Here's a mildly psychoactive tofu recipe I adapted for my own uses.

========================================================================

We All Live In A Yellow Soybean

Needed:

1 good sized block of medium firm tofu
rapeseed (Canola) oil, as needed        (Rape... seed...)
half a teaspoon of turmeric
half a teaspoon of oregano
quarter of a teaspoon of paprika
half a teaspoon of poppy seeds
2 cloves of garlic, minced to hell
2 tablespoons soy sauce.

Drain the tofu. Pat it dry, then cut it into 3/4 inch cubes. Heat about a
tablespoon of RAPESEED (or any kind of oil, I guess) oil in a wok or
electric frying pan.  Then saut‚ the tofu cubes over high heat for 5 minutes 
or so.  

Reduce heat to medium-low.  Add the turmeric and saut‚ until well
distributed. Add more oil as needed to prevent stuff from getting too dry. 
When the tofu is uniformly yellow, add the rest of the herbs and the poppy
seeds and stir, stir, stir. Then dump in the garlic, increase the heat a wee 
bit, and dump in the soy sauce.  Saut‚ until mixture is a rich
yellowy-orangey-brown colour.  Turn off wok.

Eat it on a bed of steamed rice, with a side of Living Lettuce (tm) in
vinaigrette dressing.  

Tasty! I'm a genius.

what i had for dinner today (9:29 pm  Wed Mar 18, 1998)

Soema's Cheesy Fucking Ass Salmon Kraft Dinner

You'll need:
2 things of Kraft Dinner
Milk
Margarine
Pepper
Sambal Oleck Wacky Spice Paste
2 cans of salmon
Some Pretentious White Cheddar Cheese.  The type of cheese is very very very
important.  You should discuss it at great lengths before purchase. (what,
me, bitter?)

Make the 2 things of Kraft dinner as per usual, adding more milk and more
margarine than it says to.  Put the salmon in and crush it and stir it (you
can use tuna too, but that's not as vile.)  Put half a teaspoon of sambal 
oleck paste.  A full teaspoon if you're wearing white underwear.  Grate a 
bunch of cheese into the goop.  Put a bunch of pepper in there too.  Stir it 
until the cheese is melted.

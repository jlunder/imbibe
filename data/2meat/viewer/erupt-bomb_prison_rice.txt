<eRUPT> Well actually I made bomb prison rice
<spinsane> i'm down to listen to any prison recipes you've got
<eRUPT> Well the most important thing is you need to get a onion and pepper
        from someone on kitchen staff
        Then some instant rice, some Goya sazon (they sell that actually), your
        chopped onion and pepper.  Sometimes I had someone get me like a
        cauliflower, that was rare though. Some diced summer sausage, some
        mackerel.  Pour the oil from the can of mackerel (that shit's good).
        Little squeeze cheese.
<spinsane> mmmmmmmm
           what do you cook it in?
<eRUPT> There's a microwave for each unit.  It usually works.  There's also a
        hot water dispenser, that pours like almost boiling water
<spinsane> that hot water dispenser sounds like trouble!
           i mean, shit they must give you pretty nice sized bowls too
<eRUPT> You can buy a Tupperware
        Hardest part was getting th3 onion and pepper
        That's contraband after all
        But I had a good friend in the kitchen he'd usually get me veggies and
        sometimes even sneak out some eggs
<spinsane> did you have a stove in there too?
<eRUPT> No just the microwave
<spinsane> knives?
           this shit's crazy
<eRUPT> For a knife you take your lid from the mackerel can
        And fold over two sides
<spinsane> i knew it! hahahaha
           now i'm curious how you dealt with the cauliflower
           like steam it first?
<eRUPT> I just chopped it and added it to the rice
        It steamed with the rice in the Tupperware fine enough
<spinsane> and how exactly do you microwave rice? i've never done that
<eRUPT> It's instant rice like uncle ben's
        Just add water and microwave with the cover on the Tupperware, goes fine
<spinsane> oh yeah, instant. duh. and thanks for the breakdown. that was
           fascinating
<eRUPT> I think the water already being like hot helped
        Funny though, when I came home, I was all like "I'm gonna make this rice"
        And i was like, "oh this is disgusting how did I eat this all the time?"

==========================================================

Ingredients:
------------
                - freshly butchered carcass of one (1) wolf (optional)
                - 1/4 cup RAPESEED oil  (NOT lard)
                - 1/2 cup SUGAR
                - 1/3 cup CHUNKY PEANUT BUTTER
                - 2 tablespoons PUREED TOFU (or 1 egg, if you're picky)
                - 1/4 cup SOYMILK  (or cow/rice/goat milk, if you're picky)
                - 1 tablespoon BAKING POWDER
                - a dash of SALT
                - 1 teaspoon CINNAMON
                - 1/2 teaspoon NUTMEG
                - 1/4 cup ROLLED OATS (or granola)
                - 1/4 cup RAISINS
                - 3/4 cup FLOUR

Method:
-------

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Skin and chop wolf. Make sure to remove all trace of fur.
3. Beat oil and sugar together.
4. Add peanut butter, tofu, soymilk, baking powder, salt, and spices to oil
and sugar, and beat everything together very well.  
5. Stir in oats, raisins, and flour.  
6. Mix well.
7. Drop by teaspoons onto unoiled baking sheet.
8. Bake.  Assuming the oven is preheated, it'll probably take about 15 
minutes but my first batch took a little bit longer. Check every so often.
9. Allow to cool somewhat. Then eat them all in one evening and feel guilty
because they are so good and you should have shared them with your friends/
family/roomates.

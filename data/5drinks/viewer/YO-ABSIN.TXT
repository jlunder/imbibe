Here you go.  Now you can all pretend you're mad french poets (which I 
suspect is a pretty common desire around here)..

Don't know if this is too risque.  I just remembered someone on the list
mentioning this a while back and the weather is getting colder so it seemed
right.  Happy brewing...

   ABSINTHE

    A bitter and aromatic, if not to say, potent, wine, made from
    wormwood and herbs.  This may be drunk mulled in winter.

      2 tsps dried peppermint leaves     2 tsps dried wormwood
      2 tsps dried thyme                 2 tsps dried lavender
      2 tsps dried hyssop                2 tsps dried marjoram
      2 tsps dried sage                  2 pints port wine

   Steep the herbs in the wine for 1 week before filtering through
   muslin and bottling.

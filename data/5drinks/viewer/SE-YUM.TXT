For anyone who needs a pick me up, try this..  It worked for euphonics (now 
urban shade i think)..  

300 ml Orange Juice
1/2 a banana
3 tablespoons of raspberries
2 tablespoons of peach yogourt
20 ml of Royal Jelly
200 mg of Ginseng
500 mg of Choline Bitarate
1200 mg of Ephedra
120 mg of Ginkgo Biloba
60 mg of Ginger

mix in a blender..  makes two smallish drinks or one really big drink..  good 
for those wishing to bounce off walls or be awake all night..  you'll need to 
go to a health food store for some of those ingredients..

    (batter)

    1/2 cup butter
    1 egg
    3/4 cups sugar
    1 tsp. vanilla
    2 cups flour
    1 tsp soda
    pinch of salt
    1 cup (butter)milk
    2 cups chopped rhubarb
    oatmeal optional
    apple slices, blackberries optional

    (topping)
	
    1/4 cup butter
    1 cup brown sugar
    2 tsp. cinnamon

Cream butter + sugar until fluffy, add eggs, vanilla.
Sift flour, soda, salt, add to wet ingredients alternately with buttermilk
Mix rhubarb gently into batter
Pour into a greased 9x13 cake pan and smooth
Sprinkle on topping.  (If you like, some oats between the cake and the 
topping can provide some interesting texture -- and essential fibre!)
Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until firm.
(my backyard produces blackberries and small tart apples also -- I like to 
throw them in but keep in mind it makes things a lot more moist, so hold back 
on the milk.)

this might better yield two medium cakes than one enormous one -- as one big 
blob it can take up to twice as long to bake all the way through, and has a 
way of rising that spills molten brown-sugar-topping over the edges and on to 
the bottom of your oven, making everyone believe that the house is on fire 
with the smoky smell.

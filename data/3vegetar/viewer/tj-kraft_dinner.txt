KRAFT DINNER! 

When I get home at quarter to four, 
my stomach grumbles, I slam the door. 

I open the cupboard, and find hidden treasure, 
a box of kraft dinner, is sure to give pleasure. 

I open the box, and pull out the cheese, 
a box of kraft dinner, is sure to please. 

The water starts boiling, you know you can't wait, 
Kraft dinner's not good, you know it'll be great! 

First add the butter, and then add the milk, 
Mix it all up, till it's smooth just like silk. 

Rip open the packet, and dump in the cheese, 
The powdery goodness, will put you at ease. 

Add salt and pepper, to give it some spice,
add cut-up weiners, 'cuz some protein's nice!

Now as I eye my hot, cheesy bowl,
a big squirt of ketchup is how I roll.

If you are on welfare, or a struggling student, 
A box of kraft dinner, would be the most prudent. 

This tale is ending, my belly is now full, 
Kraft's dinner's the best, and now you all know.

This is from my old poems of which were posted on tabnet many years ago, but
are mostly lost now...I wrote that one when I was a student at BCIT living
off a 7 grand a year student loan... basically summed up all that I ate..the
poem is meant to be sarcastic, heh.

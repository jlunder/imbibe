As a kid I turned up my nose at this, not realising that "coffee cake" was 
to be eaten _with_ coffee, and it took me some time to come to terms with 
the confusing deliciousness of "sour cream" as well.  (I have since graduated
to the advanced level of culinary cognitive dissonance needed in order to 
hear the bizarre phrase "bean curd skin rolls" and respond "yum, sounds 
delicious!"  But that is a different dish.)

This is one of those traditional Christmas baking items that ... whatever
your function, you never wind up taking any of this one back home.

     1 cup butter
     1.5 cups sugar
     1 cup sour cream (1/2 "pint" or container.  unless you double recipe of
     course.  you should always double this recipe.  quadruple if you can!)
     2 eggs, beaten
     1 teaspoon vanilla
     2 cups flour
     1 teaspoon baking powder
     1/4 teaspoon salt
     1/2 teaspoon baking soda
     top with nuts, sugar, cinnamon

crumble flour, butter, sugar, baking powder together "as for pie crust"
add vanilla, eggs, sour cream.  beat for 5 minutes, pour in greased loaf pan.
sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon and nuts (may need patting in -- or mix in 
poppy seeds if you are feeling especially central European.)
Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  Perform the wooden toothpick test to
determine whether it has baked all the way through.

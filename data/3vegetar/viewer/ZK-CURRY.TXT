Dog's Blood Curry  
=================

1. Obtain the following ingredients:
            - TVP (textured soya protein). Get it from health food stores
            or Indian markets.
            - bottle of "Shahi Indian Magic Curry Masala Sauce" or any 
                other pre-bottled masala or vindaloo sauce.
            - leftover vegetables from fridge 
                        (I used:  - half a potato
                                  - a few wilted coriander leaves
                                  - about 10 dried-up mushroom slices)

2. Take 1/2 cup of TVP. Put it aside in a bowl with 1/2 cup of hot water.
        Let it sit for ten minutes or so.

3. Put a suitable amount of curry sauce (I used maybe 4 tbsp) in a saucepan.
        Add softened TVP. Stir until well marinated. Add water until there
        is a fairly liquidy but not weak consistency. 

4. Chop potato, etc. into small cubes. Dump veggies into pot. Stir.

5. Put pot on a medium-high element. Stir for a few minutes until it starts
        boiling. Put the lid on and reduce heat to medium-low.  Simmer for
        fifteen minutes or until the potato bits are cooked and chewably
        soft. At this point, it would be wise to start up a pot of white
        fast-cooking basmati rice -- as much as you need for yourself.

6. Finished?  Put on plate with rice and eat.  Bread and butter substitutes
        very well for rice if you can't be bothered.

7. Eat with plenty of water and celebrate your culinary inventiveness.

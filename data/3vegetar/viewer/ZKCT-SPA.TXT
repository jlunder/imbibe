[Ed. - in this period there was often a quantity of leftover neglect pasta in
my fridge, either with the hell boiled out of it, or sometimes salvaged from a
pot of genuinely burned noodles, with a vague carbon aftertaste.  It was just
fuel for the furnace, but I would never presume to impose my barbarism on a

culinary pastures, but this contortionistic improvised sauce recipe must be a
foodie's refusal to take the dismissal of "there is genuinely nothing here I
can feed you" sitting down.  "Oh YEAH?  Well let's see how relatively less-
terrible I can make this, with the stark paucity of options I have available
here in the pantry of bachelor despair!]

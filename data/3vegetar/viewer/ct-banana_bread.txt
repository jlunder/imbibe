[Ed.  Around the turn of the century I baked, ate and bombed potlucks with
enormous quantities of banana bread, largely because my regular travels often
had me passing by a pile of free bananas out front of a neighbourhood 
greengrocer in the wee hours.  Upon learning that bananas were often put to
work as an egg substitute in vegan baking, I asked myself just why the eggs
were present at all in a conventional banana bread recipe, other than to troll
the vegans.  What would the downside of having extra bananas in your banana
bread be, it tasting excessively banana-y?]

1 cup sugar
1 cup oil (or butter)
2 beaten eggs (or... another banana)
pinch salt
4 tbsp buttermilk (apparently optional, I never use it)
2 cups flour
1 tsp baking soda
3 bananas
grate nutmeg (a fiddly step that can also be omitted)
(my wife and children were scandalized to learn that there were no chocolate
chips present in my recipe.  I guess my youth was more austere than theirs.
Feel free to throw in a handful or two if you can't choke down the sweetness
of rotting bananas without the bump offered by chocolate.)

beat bananas into mixture before adding flour.
grease the loaf pan -- in oven for about 70 minutes at 350 degrees C.

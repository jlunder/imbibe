The magical
MISORONI
=========

you will need:

- 2-3 cups macaroni/shell/whatever noodles
- 6 tbsp oil
- 6 tbsp flour
- lots of nutritional yeast (like a cup or so)
- 1/3 cup of miso
- 2 cups soy milk (approx)
- half a small onion
- 1/3 cup shredded cabbage
- salt and pepper
- sourdough breadcrumbs (as desired)

Boil macaroni. While you're doing that, put oil and flour in a small saucepan 
and warm on low heat, stirring until smooth. Add soymilk, stir, bring to a 
boil. Reduce heat. Add nutritional yeast until you have a cheese-saucy 
texture. If the texture isn't right, adjust flour/soymilk quantities. Remove 
from heat, stir in miso. Make sure the miso isn't clumpy; you might want to 
mix it with a little water before hand so that it's a kind of puree. 

Drain pasta.
Cut up onion and cabbage. Mix with pasta in a large casserole. 
Pour sauce over top and stir unil well covered. Osterize breadcrumbs and 
sprinkle on top.

Cover and bake in 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. In the last 5 minutes, 
remove top to brown breadcrumbs.

Serve with quantities of salt and pepper, spinach salad (or other dark green 
vegetable) and orange juice.

This recipe, which was my experimental adaptation of a vegan mac-and-cheese 
recipe (I added miso and removed tofu), turns out with a very cheesy casserole
texture and a satisfying taste. It doesn't taste like cheese, but it is quite 
good none the less. The miso gives it a salty flavour; the more miso you add, 
the saltier it is. 

I'm sure this recipe could be improved but I'm not totally sure how. Perhaps 
the addition of garlic/garlic salt...

It's a heavy dinner and makes a lot of leftovers. Very satisfying.

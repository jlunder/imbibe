Baby Jesus' Egalitarian "Autumn Medley" Pretend Pizzas

Holy Ingredients:

        - wholewheat mini pita breads 
        - 1 can of stewed tomatoes (NOT tomato sauce or soup)
        - small jar Unico artichoke hearts
        - a few slices of onions
        - garlic clove (chopped coarsely)
        - salted pumpkin seeds (bought bulk)

Secular Ingredients (Add/Modify as you please):

        AKA "Things I had to get rid of before they went bad"

        - a few slices of green pepper
        - zucchini remnants (I highly recommend this, although
                I know many of you feel strongly about zucchini)
        - broccoli florets (chopped tiny)
        - cheese and meat make baby jesus cry.  You can put them
                on if you like, but it's really better without.

Take the pitas and put them on a baking sheet. Chop about half the
stewed tomatoes coarsely, drain, and then pile them on the breads. Put
on the rest of the veggies, with artichokes and garlic last.  Then sprinkle
pumpkin seeds on the top.

        Put the baking tray in the oven under the grill for 10-15 minutes.
        Remove AFTER the veggies start wilting but BEFORE the whole pizza 
        becomes horribly burned and mutilated.

Eat (watch out for the hot pumpkin seeds!) and thank the baby jesus for his   
vegetable bounty.

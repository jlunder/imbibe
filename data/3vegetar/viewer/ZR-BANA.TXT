From the Bloody Kitchen...
Herr Experimental Weegun Bananah Bread

I made this stuff after combining and revising 3 different banana bread
recipes and it is
the shit.

Sift:    1 and 3/4 cups flour
         4 teaspoons baking powder
         1/2 teaspoon baking soda
         1/4 teaspoon salt

Blend:    1/3 cup vegetable oil
          2/3 cup sugar

Add the wet stuff to the dry stuff.  Then,

Mash:    2 ripe (ie. spotted with brown) bananas

And throw them in the mixture.  Blend well.  If you have poppyseeds, add a
suitable amount. Now this mixture will be rather stiff, so here's where the
soymilk comes in.  Just keep blending and add as much soymilk (I used
"Vanilla and Almond Flavoured Soy Beverage" but I'm sure any flavour, or
even just water, will work fine) as is needed (probably between half a cup
and a cup. start with half a cup and keep adding until it's a moisty, thick
goop, thicker than batter but thinner than dough.)

Take a bread pan.  Grease it up.  Put the weegun bananah b-read in.

Stick it in a 350 degree (preheated) oven for an hour.  Then take it out,
wait for it to cool a bit (not too long, it's best warm) and eat huge
amounts.

Mmmmmm......  banana-y......

Even my brother, the warez grubber who hates anything non-processed and
meat-free, ripped off a huge chunk and gorged it down.

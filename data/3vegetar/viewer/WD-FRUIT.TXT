fruit.

mmm.


how to prepare fruit the jocelyn way
====================================
(for each of them, you'll need a knife, and sugar).


strawberries
------------

you'll need:    a small knife
                sugar
                more than one serving of strawberries
                a big bowl

procedure:      cut the strawberries into little slice from the tip to
                the leafy end.  pick off the green leafy stuff.

                sprinkle enough sugar that at least a pinch covers
                every single strawberry slice.

                cover the bowl.

                stick the bowl in the fridge for a day.
                wait for a day.
                come back to the fridge after waiting for a day.

                take off the cover.

                mix the strawberries around thouroughly.

                eat.


bananas
--------

note:  bananas were never meant to be eaten alone.  it's just not right.

you'll need:    a banana
                a small knife
                sugar
                a big bowl
                milk


procedure:      peel the banana.  but don't peel the whole thing.  just
                peel one strip off, and loosen the remaining peel.

                cut the banana from one end to the other into small
                slices no thicker than 5mm.

                pour milk into the bowl until you can barely see the
                bananas anymore.

                sprinkle sugar generously.. again, so that at least a
                pinch covers each slice.

                mix lightly.  

                eat the slices.

                there will no doubt be milk left over.
                sprinkle some more sugar into the bowl.
                mix.
                drink the milk.

                wipe your mouth.  (this step is always necessary, even
                if you're a clean eater).  
                


apples
------

you'll need:    a knife
                a small amount of sugar (but it's optional this time)
                an apple
                a plate

procedure:      grab the stem of the apple, but do not pull.  twist
                the stem, and say one letter of the alphabet with each
                twist.  when the stem comes off, the letter you say will
                be the first letter of the girl who likes you.  heehee.

                cut the apple in half and take out the core.  
                peel the apple.
                dice it.  

                put the slices into a microwavable bowl and put it in
                the microwave for 30 seconds on high.

                sprinkle a little little little bit of sugar on.

                put it in the fridge for a few hours.
                take it out of the fridge after a few hours.

                mix.

                eat.



melons of any kind
------------------

slice, and sprinkle very very very lightly with sugar.

Wow, this recipe turned out even better than I expected. It's really, really 
good (really).

BLACK EYED BEAN CUTLETS  (A LA KING)

get:
         - a can of black-eyed beans (1.29 at Joe's Market)
         - 1 carrot (washed, not peeled)
         - 1/5th of an onion
         - 1 garlic clove
         - soy sauce
         - salt and pepper
         - some bread
         - curry powder
         - a blender

BLENDERIZE peas, carrot, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and a splash of soy 
sauce until it resembles mush but some resemblence of their former textures 
still remains. Remove from blender. Wash blender. 

BLENDERIZE BREAD WITH CURRY POWDER until you have about a cup or more of fine 
bread crumbs all turmericky.

By hand, mix all the stuff together. You want it to be soft but firm enough to
stick together reasonably well.

By hand, make into hamburger-sized patties. Fry in hot oil until kinda browny 
and crispy on each side. Don't worry if they fall apart; they still taste 
good. 

Eat those motherfuckers! They're really tasty (not spicy) and filling and 
nutritious and all that.

This recipe makes way too much black-eyed mush for one meal, so refridgerate 
the uncooked portions in a bowl with saran wrap.

I'm eating some right now. With water, even.

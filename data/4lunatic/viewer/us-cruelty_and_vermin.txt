(Adel Faure posts ASCII portrait of new French Prime Minister, 2024)

<Cthulu> I like those policies!
         Makes me wonder what will happen to French foie gras production
         however
<Adel Faure> There is a lot of small farm making foie gras but yeah even small
             or organic it is still basically torturing an animal to make its
             liver sick and eat it
<Cthulu> I remember a story about how French scientists made a mind map of the
         goose, learning what the different parts of its brain did in relation
         to its behaviors, so they could find and neutralize the appetite
         regulation centre of its brain, yielding a goose that would willingly
         force feed itself yielding humane fois gras
         But even so it turns out that a goose that ate as fast as it could
         24/7 still delivered inferior fois gras too inefficiently, the only
         viable way to deliver the popular delicacy is it turns out is through
         unimaginable cruelty
<nitron> its because cruelty is delicious; see: veal
<littlebitspace> Cruelty doesn't make anything delicious, umami does
<nitron> it's something people who like things like fois gras and veal say to
         each other and chuckle over. i don't really do either but i don't
         pretend to judge. at the end of the day nothing lives without it
         consuming something else that also lives.
<Cthulu> The inhumane treatment really feels like adding insult to injury.  I
         don't eat a lot of meat but I try to do so thoughtfully
<MC Fresher> It's weird; I don't like that Bessie has to be bludgeoned to
             death for a tasty burger, but I feel nothing for the crickets in
             an Impossible Whopper.
<Cthulu> It's a story we've long told ourselves, that only the bigger animals
         more like us perceive reality like we do, long theorizing that smaller
         and simpler animals don't even experience fear and pain
         New research suggesting that plants feel pain is a challenge for this
         school of ethics
         Only the fruititarians get off scott free!
<nitron> i know a couple gals who almost died trying to be fruititarians
<indyjonez> Yeah, it's not very sustainable. Not much protein in fruit, nor
            all of the essential amino acids
[Cthulu  hmmm.. what about the wasps in figs?]
<indyjoenz> but the fiber and vitamins in fruit are great! 
<Cthulu> I don't endorse fruititarianism, which is not sustainable, but it's
         worth thinking about where the happy mean is.
<indyjonez> I haven't eaten a cow or a chicken (or pig) in over 20 years. I
            did eventually start eating fish again. I reckon I would have to be
            pretty hungry to do my own hunting/fishing, though 
            I don't think I could eat crickets. Again, unless I was hungry
            enough
<nitron> I'm on a 'C' food died. If I see food, I eat it. ha ha ha
         this reminds me i owe cthulu a recipe or two if i can shoot them out
         before it's too late
<Cthulu> If you eat peanut butter, you are eating grasshoppers.
<littlebitspace> If the amount is nutritionally insignificant it doesn't count
<atonalosprey> I asked my family for edible crickets last Christmakwanzukkah...
               they were pretty good, but for the food of the future way too
               pricey
<Cthulu> You're also eating rats in peanut butter... While it's not a large
         component of the mix, I think most people would rate it as significant
         and counting to learn that they are regularly ingesting _any_ rat
         content in their diet
<littlebitspace> In which part of the process does the rat and grasshopper get
                 in the product? I'm curious to know
<Cthulu> Largely I think when giant machines scour the fields and scoop up all
         the legumes and anything that may be in the field snacking on them
         I remember learning of this while doing research in the Vancouver
         public library circa 1995 for the never-released Concrete emag
         It is just to say it's easier to wrap your head around eating bugs
         when you learn that actually you've been eating bugs all along and it
         was never a problem before 
         Maybe I should bottle this conversation for inclusion in Imbibe as
         well!
<littlebitspace> The article mentions insect fragments and rat hair which is
                 much different than eating grasshoppers and rats
<Cthulu> If at any point the foods are stored in a silo or transported on a
         train I imagine there are openings for bugs and rodents to find their
         way in also
         You're not eating entire intact insects or animals, but fragments of
         the pulverized remains of them after being mangled in a conveyor belt
         and sent through a roaster
         If you sent a healthy dead rat (died of old age?) through a blender
         and dehydrated and ground up what remained, most people still
         wouldn't want you sprinkling that powder on their supper
<littlebitspace> There probably are tiny human fragments in the mix as well
<Cthulu> I think they stop the line when a human falls into the peanut mangler
<littlebitspace> Human hair counts as fragments
<Cthulu> Human hair gets into the food when a worker needs to adjust their
         hairnet, presumably that can't be said of the rodents
         I do like the visual image of all the rat workers in the Ratatouille
         nut processing plant though
         ...
         I love how we got here from a look at the policy promises of the new
		 French prime minister
<littlebitspace> Is this still the same conversation? I totally missed the
                 middle part
                 This would be a great epyc prompt
<indyjonez>  Peanut butter and roach poop. Breakfast of champions
<mozz> speaking of eating rodents

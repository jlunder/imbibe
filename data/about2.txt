1998 June:

The Mighty Cthulu: "hey joe, can I take advantage of your hax0rly skillz to
                    produce an 3l33te e-mag called imbibe, all about food?"
The 313370 hAx0R j03: "w0w! that sounds liK3 a r3et el33t ide4! g3t Me soME
                       aRticlez aNd I'll get hax0ring!"

1998 August:

The 31ee70 haXoR J03: "h3y r0wan, wHEre arE th3 artic1es j00 prOMiseD me?"

1998 October:

The 3lit3 hAx0R j03: "ROWAN, th33 ARTICLEZ?"

1998 December:

The 313370 HAx0r Joe: "ROWAN YOU HOOR! I'VE BEEN ON YOUR ASS ABOUT THOSE
                       ARTICLES FOR MONTHS NOW! GET ME THOSE ARTICLES!"

1999 March:

The Mighty Cthulu: "Here are the articles 8)"
The 313370 hAx0R j03: "s0rRy. I w4it3d 8 m0nths, and now I've ins7a113d
                       leenooks like a g00d little hax0r. um, TS 4 n0w, er..
                       <sh33pi5H lo0k>"

1999 September:

The 31337 hAX0R j00: "y33h4w I bought a 1337 l4PT0P for sch00L! it onLy runz
                      LOSED0ZE, which I have to run anyh0w 4 skewl."

1999 December 19 (sunday) ~10h:

The 37331 hAck3R j03: "I'm bored. I think I'll code imbibe."


fortunately, the articles were written (thanks forever to my pack-rat nature)
onto a CD-R backup of one of my hard drives before The Mighty Cthulu's hard
drive got exploded by The Evil Laughing Linux Hax0r. I was able to get to work
straight away.

anyway, you can see that this project has been underway for over a year now.
that means it must be really good, right?


right?

imbibe e-mag viewer:

the source code for imbibe weighs ~100k, which is ~5000 lines of C++ for me
(85 or so typewritten pages), making it the largest single project I've ever
completed. for better or worse, that's not that big on the scale of things.
still. I'm a little proud.

my development tools (for DOS) are: Watcom C++ 10.6, Tran's PMODE/W, and edit.
the Watcom remote debugger for Windows is the bomb. edit is the tool of satan.

therefore I am satan. worship me.

imbibe is absurdly overdesigned. I hope to exploit that later by writing lots
of e-mag viewers with really weird features and graphical easter-eggs: so if
you have an idea for an e-mag and want a viewer coded, I would be happy to
oblige. send mail to hackerjoe0@hotmail.com. it might take me a week or two to
respond, but I will respond, so be patient.


greets and dedications are for losers who know other people.

When I'm depressed I tend to eat food that requires as little chewing as
possible.

Applesauce.
Oatmeal.
Soft mushy bread with marmalade.
Soup.

Maybe I revert back to infancy -- remembering the good old days of mommy
spoon-feeding me strained apricots and mushy peas.

Or maybe I just don't have the energy.

This is because your mind is pre-occupied with other things. You must be
really depressed!

I make elaborate meals consisting of no fewer than ten different things,
then eat about half of each of them.

the more difficult to eat and the smaller the portion the better.

Maybe the ritual takes your mind off other things.

Anorexics frequently have very elaborate eating rituals, when they eat at
all.

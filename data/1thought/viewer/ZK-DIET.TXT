Very true. Except I'd be a militant revolutionary dietician. I'd form a gang 
of other dieticians called FOOD FOR DEATH and we'd launch graffiti wars and
kidnap members of parliament.

Our first project would be to firebomb Save-On-Meats on E. Hastings.  That
place is so revolting. It does not make the neighborhood any nicer.  Then
we'd rob the Kitsilano Panini Parlours and distribute the nutritious but
overpriced booty in the downtown eastside.  

Yeah. And then we'd hold the nation hostage for 3 weeks demanding that they
stop feeding surplus grain to beef cows and instead send it overseas to The
Starving Children In Russia.  

A more peaceful demonstration would be the Breast-In.  3000 new mothers
breast feeding on the steps of the Art Gallery.  It'd be beautiful, man.

Oh, and I'd also demand that the Cannabis Cafe open a bakery selling their
hemp-seed bread at reasonable prices instead of hoarding it for their rich
customers. It is really, really, really delicious and nutritious bread.

Vive la revolucion!

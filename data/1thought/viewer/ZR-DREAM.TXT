McDonald's was tired of animal rights complaints and the accusation that
rainforests were suffering under their mighty whip, so they made a slight
alteration in the types of food animals used in their burgers.

Instead of cows, pigs, and chickens, they decided to use guinea pigs,
hedgehogs, chihuahuas, yorkshire terriers, bunny rabbits, featherless geese, 
and hamsters.

Their slogan was, "It may look funny, but it tastes like real beef."

I was ecstatic -- "Westerners have deep-seated taboos about eating these
animals! McDonald's is going down the drain!"

Went to alert my dad, who was in the process of munching down a Triple
Double Cheese Mac With Extra "Beef"... he looked slightly irked, finished
the burger, and then said, "Well, that was my last one."

I still wonder whether or not we would "adjust" to eating puppies and guinea 
pigs if McDonald's started serving them.  Or maybe we would all just head
over to Burger King.

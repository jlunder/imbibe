The Hacker's Nutritional Guide

[1mHacker Philosophy of Eating[0m

Eating is generally viewed by most hackers as wasted time. For example,
10 seconds taken to eat a bite of [33mCola[1;37m-Gummi[0m can mean the difference between
Morris/Torvalds level concentration (big-endian concentration) and
distraction.  Time taken for such ridiculous things as sleep, going to the
washroom, or food are considered goofing off to the majority of hard-headed
coders out there and circuit-frying hardware weenies. Therefore, the hacker
diet is most compact and time efficient (except when it is not, which is
expected.) Of course, these fine principles of nutrition fade in the face of
personal taste, and weakness and distraction. But they help for those long
nights when you simply must finish the Goddamn Code and there are [32mgremlins[37m on
the inside of your SGI that are putting errors in the static libraries _you
are sure of it!_

[1mEating Habits[0m

        There are two schools of hacker feeding:

[1mNothingness[0m: Eating as little as possible, whenever possible.
             Usually 20 meals a day.
[1mGluttony[0m: Eating as much as possible in large bursts, usually 1 meal a day.

        These schools of thought are variable of course. When a hacker is on
daylight hours (not coding, hacking) and on social occasions, these
conventions break down. It is also interesting to note that you can identify
a hacker by diet. Anybody who constantly drinks [1;34mwater[0m/[33mCoca-Cola[37m and eats
[33mBoost[37m fuel replacement bars is probably a hack.

[1mFour Major Food Groups Groups[0m

The big four are:
      [1mCaffeine[0m/[1mStimulants[0m/[1mMedicinals[0m
      [1mCarbohydrate Group[0m
      [1mPetrochemical Group[0m
      [1mSugar Group[0m
      [1mExceptions[0m (Not really a group)

      [1mCaffeine[0m/[1mStimulants[0m/[1mMedicinals[0m

            Generally Caffeine/Stimulants/Medicinals can be any substance
(usually pharmecutical in nature) that enhances the performance of the
following systems in the body:

      Parasympathetic Nervous System (Fight-or-Flight reactions to maintain
        nervous edge)
      Central Nervous System (Higher brain functions such as object
        subclassing in C++)
      Sombulatic Repression Loop aka Asimbulatic Loop (Sleep repression part
        of a person's metabology.)
      Various Glandular systems for low-level body hacking (For stimulation
        of the appropriate hormones, fine-tuning performance.)

            Exceptions to this general rule are substances that may be a
ritualistic part of hacking. For example, substances like [33mElacca[37m and [1;33mmustard[0m
powder are used for a total digestive system cleansing after a bad hack. They
serve no purpose other than ritual, but then again, that is important to
mental health.

      A List of Common Caffeine Sources

      These are good caffeine sources.  Tested and selective. Others may
imitate them, but each source has its benefits.  To a true Berkeley hacker
(esoteric west coast AI coders and ex-BSD project staff) caffeine sources are
like [35mwine[37m. An example would be [33mDr. Pepper[37m. It has a rich, sweet, and acient
taste. It rolls pleasantly off ones soft palate, and leaves just the right
pressure of CO2 in the sinuses. Best served [34mice cold[37m in warm weather (when
the nitrogen cooler on the Cray blows itself out, or the air conditioning
goes.)

      A List of Common Caffeine Sources

      [33mCoke[37m ([33mCoca-Cola[37m)
      [33mCoffee[37m
      [33mBukkett Coffee[37m (Dangerous, from Div Bukkett bucket@sultry.ai.unc.edu)

      [1;36mIntervenous drip[0m (careful with this one.)
      [31mCardiac[37m injection (St. John's ambulance kits have best percentages or
        parts per million.)
      Any [32mStarbucks[37m variety that is over $300 a gram.

            [1mCarbohydrate Group[0m

            Carbohydrates are the primary weapon of a person (or what's left
of a sysadmin) who has been fasting. It is also the solemn dirge of one who
loves to consume until [1;34mblue[0m in the face. For the nothing school of eating,
carbohydrates are best consumed before a long period of work. For the glutton
school, they are best consumed all through the period of work. The most
effective and time efficient way to consume carbohydrates is intervenously.
This is difficult to do for reasons best mentioned, lest a fanatic read this:
Intervenous does not work well for people with high blood pressure. It does
not, therefore, go down well with our hack heart rates. We could explode the
drip bag.

      Preparation

            Carbohydrates are best prepared boiled to nothingness ([1mmash[0m
[1mpotato[0m primordial soup) or dry. There is some leeway with purified [1;34mwater[0m,
seeing that cooking is not neccesary to produce a completely bacteria-free
product.  Please make sure that the product you try to cook is SEALED well.
Otherwise, there could still be a[1;35m germ o[0mr two left in the food. That just
wouldn't do.  The fragile health betw[1;35me[0men coma and hyperactivity, hacks must
guard their immune systems well. Remember when the old VM machines were in a
glass house?  That was there to make sure the admins didn't get colds.

            [1mPetrochemical Group[0m

            [1;30mDinosaur piss[0m is good stuff. For one, it makes up plastic, so why
not eat it? Surely if a rubber boot can last 2000 years a human can if he/she
eats enough hydrocarbons. There are a couple of ways to purchase the proper
petrochemical:

      Make sure the gas station/COSTCO is well stocked with non-[33mchocolate[37m
items.
      Purchase the mooshy, hard, covered with [1;32macidic crystal[0m stuff. It
preserves your ulcer well.
      Buy nothing less than 300g at once.
      The cheapest are the best.

      It is best to buy your petrochemicals from a reputable manufacturer.
It is a rumour at the USGS (United States Geological Survey) that [32mSaudi[37m
[32mArabian[37m-derived [1;33mfoam bananas[0m are better than the American variety. Many
patriotic[31m [37mCanadians died to bring us this information. Use it well. Do not
buy from [31mTexaco[37m.

      List of Common Petrochemical products

      [1;33mChicken boullion[0m cubes

            [1mSugar Group[0m

            The world of [1msugar[0m consumption is governed by only a couple of
rules.  For the purposes of this Guide, the reader is left to fend for
him/herself in the matter of choice. All[1m sugar [0mis good, be it extruded
([1;35mcandyfloss[0m) or crystalized ([1mrock candy[0m.)

      Rules of Sugar Selection:

            Cost is no object for good[1m sugar[0m!

      Quality is generally better than quantity. (eg. One Trouffalt de Four
at Quiver's of Paris or 432[33m Mars Bars[37m world wide? There is no question.)

      Avoid the dreade[1md organic sugar [0mand[1;33m honey[0m-sweetened goods. They merely
pretend to be something that they are not.

      [33mJolt Cola[37m is an excellent source of[1m sugar[0m!

      Some hackers thrive on regularity of diet (3[33m Mars Bars [37ma day) and some
on absolute diversity. FIND OUT WHICH YOU ARE!

      The Exceptions to the Groups (Because hacking involves exceptions)

            Make any exceptions you like. If you are a bisexual gerbil from
Romania, and you enjoy fruit-sweetened organic[1;31m carrots[0m, go right ahead. Eat
them.  See if I care. You are only as good as the number of exceptions you
have to this list. As a matter of fact, I am hoping to gauge the health of
the hack community by reading all the hatemail that this Guide gets. Flame
me, please. Hackdom is better as [1;34mSpock[0m put it, in Infinite Diversity in
Infinite Combinations.

      Good Dietary Habits:

            Eat. If you die, it means that you have either eaten too much or
too little.SAUCE00                                                                           20250208².  P ï      IBM VGA               

Good lord, I consume a huge amount of wheat. Rare are the meals which do 
not contain the sacred grain.  Breakfast tends to be granola or oatmeal.
Lunch usually involves some kind of bread and/or crackers (I discovered a
Wheat & Rye President's Choice cracker that is very tasty and very 
affordable).  Dinner tends to be pasta or involve bread.  I bought some
bulgur pilaf only to discover that bulgur is a wheat product. (so are cous
cous and oats, just so you know).

So I'm thinking -- we haven't come much further than our friends the
early agriculturalists. Of course, now we have super-big-evil-corporate
post-industrial farmCo(tm) reaping the wheat, but the diet still rests
upon that staple.  More so for me because I don't eat animals, but I'm
sure everyone here eats wheat at least once a day, probably significantly
more.

When I was in Japan, it was the same way, except with rice. Even the candies
and crackers and chips were made of rice. There was ALWAYS a bowl of plain
white rice with dinner, no exceptions.  The rice man came to the Bailey's 
house once a week with a huge 40-pound bag, which was poured into the giant
rice dispenser cabinet. We are quick to jump at other cultures for eating 
"nothing but" rice, potatoes, animal innards, etc. but our diet really is 
not that interesting at all.

Sure, we have access to things that our parents living in Alberta 30 years
ago wouldn't have dreamed of -- broccoli, fruit all year round, soy foods,
everything exotic and unnameable you could think of -- but we're still 
basically a bunch of clods stuffing bread into our mouths after using it to
wipe up the gravy, and throwing the bones to the dogs.

I could give up bread -- my mother has, it aggravates her allergies -- and
wheat, but it would take a major adjustment in my lifestyle, just as giving
up meat entailed an enormous adjustment. 

Eh, just pondering.

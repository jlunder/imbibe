Sexual Diaries                   

Kimchi ramen. 69cents a bowl, nutritionally void, but it makes your nose and 
eyes run, clears out cheese-induced phlegm and induces intellectual trance 
states whereby you will be able to write for 1.5 hours with hardly any cease. 
However, the crash is not a soft one.

Furthermore, after consuming hallucinatory kimchi ramen, do not, if you see a 
large pill which looks like it might be either ginseng, echinacea, or kava 
kava on the floor and whose presence can only be explained by its presumed 
drop from the pocket of Josh's brown felt jacket, do not (I repeat), after a 
preemptory sniff, do not (once again, I reiterate) eat it.

It will, naturally, be kava kava (or worse), the legendary trance drug of 
New Guinea islanders. Consumption will result in a sudden desire to inseminate
prepubescent boys. Fantasies of green monkeys and swingsets will return for 
the first time since grade seven when you were taught all the wrong, horribly 
wrong things about AIDS under the premise of maintaining the condom companies'
world monopoly on penetrative sex acts.

Ever wonder just _why_ our sexualities are constructed with paradigmatic 
emphasis on penis-in-vagina (the only sex act legal in all 50 states is the 
placement of penis in vagina -- Joseph Bristow (?))?  Well, it's because of 
those condom companies. It has nothing to do with those silly assumptions 
about "reproduction" and "survival of the species" -- sure, they are a part of
the fabric of our justification, but that's just what Durex wants you to 
believe. 

30,000 years of oppression by a single corporation.
I kill historians with my ramen breath. Kimchi ho!

Zinnia Lit-From-Within:

I have a spatula and a pressure cooker, so don't no one better be not
messing with me!

The spatula and pressure cooker message was true, and just so you know,
here are the various things I am bringing (so far) to the kitchen in
bUrQuItLUm:

From: Sylphid                          

the sudden reality "oh damn i'm going to be living in burquitlam" hit me the 
other day.  very umpleasant.

what was the name of that really odd suburb we saw a sign for when driving to 
burquitlam?  started with an S...  i want to go there :)

Z> spatula (duh)
Z> 2 medium size saucepans
Z> 1 small saucepan
Z> 1 medium size frying pan
Z> dish-drying rack
Z> mondo superb blender-food processor type thing (my grandmother forced it
Z> on me, it's one of her massive collection of electronic kitchen gadgets --
Z> she doesn't need it anymore)
S> 
S> sounds froopaloucious.  my family has an insane number of dishes and
S> cutlery and stuffs (as they said), so that won't be a worry.  we also have
S> this old foldy ikea kitchen table thing, so that's good.  any minor things
S> such as big spoons and stuff my parents most likely either have now or
S> will buy soon.
S> 
Z> And, some things I CAN bring but which we probably won't need:
Z> 
Z> strange handled toast thinger (a stovetop toaster? I don't know what you
Z> call it. It's like a flat tin frying-pan with perforations in it.)
S> 
S> um.. i have no idea :)  we have an old beat-up toaster that still works,
S> so that's fine.
S> 
Z> pressure cooker (no one needs a pressure cooker)
S> 
S> pressure cookers are dangerous and they scare me.  unless you want to use
S> it, don't bother
S> 
Z> No, I have a feeling it would explode and take half my face with it. My
Z> parents can keep it.
Z>
Z> tin stovetop kettle
S> 
S> ah, we have a kettle as well.  i need it for my pump coffee thingie
S> 
Z> electric frying pan  (I don't know if it works or not)
S> 
S> you say you already have a frying pan.. this should be unnecessary
S> 
Z> and some frighteningly tarnished silver ladles.  I'm not getting into
Z> anything that needs polishing.  All of the above (except the spatula,
Z> which I bought) are donated from family members and family friends, and
Z> all are fairly ancient but in good working order.
Z> 
Z> Oh: I also have spices. There were these little glass spice jars lying
Z> around empty and I filled up a bunch of them with spices. I don't know how
Z> much coriander you use in your own cooking, but just so you know it's there
Z> at your disposal.
S> 
S> that's fine.  my cooking is usually slightly more functional than
S> elaborate, and i usually don't use many if any spices.  except when i make
S> chili or anything else with tomatoey-sauce stuff.  mmm.
S> 
S> my parents and i are going to go to costco just before moving day and get 
S> non-perishable cooking items (soy sauce, oils, etc) so that will be fine.
S> 
Z> My mom is buying me, in her own words, "A BIG BAG OF RICE".  She's afraid
Z> I'll get some bizarre nutritional deficiency. Oh no! Not enough
Z> Riboflavin!
S> 
S> i feel like we're getting married or something :)
S> 
Z> What... they didn't tell you?  That's part of the deal. We can't be living
Z> in sin, now can we?
S> 
S> if any of the previous message is incoherent or badly-spelled please 
S> forgive me, i'm on a touch of coedine.  all this food talk is making me so 
S> hungry and my swollen mouth won't accept any food.  noOo.
S> 
Z> Mmmmmmmmmm poppyseeds.

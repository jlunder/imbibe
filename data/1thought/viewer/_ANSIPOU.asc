One night on #ansi...

<radman>  _Cthulu: hey dude do you have POUTINE
<Cthulu>  not only do we have it, we even eat it once in a while.  we can get 
          it from burger king.
<radman>  hey 
<radman>  how do you spell poutine
<radman>  I'm looking for a poutine recipe on the 'net, something
<radman>  poutine is spelled poutine?
<Cthulu>  radman - "poutine".  Fries, gravy and cheese curds.
<Cthulu>  Though cheeze whiz mixed in with the gravy will do in a pinch 8)
<radman>  _Cthulu: UGH!
<Cthulu>  man - hey, when I cross the border and all of a sudden start seeing
          "fried pig rind" in convenience stores, I don't feel too appetized
          either 8)
<Cthulu>  I wonder if you find a hair in them once in a while.
<tna>     cthulu: no you don't
<Cthulu>  This is more of a quebec thing than a canada one... I only know
          about it 'cause I was in french immersion.
<tna>     cthulu: poutine rules.
<Cthulu>  poutine kicks ass.
<Cthulu>  over american fast food, at least 8)
<radman>  ahahahahha
<radman>  I dont eat pig rinds     
<Cthulu>  and I rarely eat poutine 8)
<radman>  
<radman>  A Traditional Quebecois Sensation
<radman>  
<radman>  Recipe
<radman>  
<radman>  Take one bowl of french fries, the greasier the better. Add a couple
<radman>  of tablespoons of cheddar cheese curds. Then smother
<radman>  with hot turkey gravy. 
<radman>
<radman>  Serving Suggestion
<radman>
<radman>  It's perfectly respectable to serve it alone as a meal, however most
<radman>  truck drivers would want a couple of dogs on the side, and
<radman>  maybe a can of coke to wash it down with. 
<radman>  AHHH, POUTINE       
<radman>  
<radman>  Eating Suggestion
<radman>
<radman>  Each fry is to be held with a fork and lovingly caressed. Dip it in
<radman>  some sauce, hold it up, examine it closely, let the sauce drip
<radman>  off. Admire it for what it is. 
<radman>
<radman>  Chew it slowly to enjoy the flavour. Mix it up a bit, perhaps a
<radman>  couple of fries, then a curd. Or have fun: have 2 or 3 curds in a
<radman>  row. Poutine is supposed to be a fun meal.
<radman>
<radman>  However, if its cold, then consume it quickly. Dont wait for the
<radman>  grease to congeal.
<radman>  ...
<radman>  congealed grease, there's nothing worse!
<Cthulu>  yeah, pigskin is worse 8)
<radman>  hahahahha
<tna>     radman: msg me your address, i'll send you an envelop of premixed
          poutine sauce.. the kinda things you just need to add water :)
<radman>  tna: really?  there is such a thing?  A poutine gravy powder?
<radman>  tna: is it just turkey gravey? 
<tna>     no, its really a poutine sauce.. i'll try to get like, the best
          around..
          tho its not as good as the sauce you get to eat in other
          restaurants. :)
<radman>  so what qualifies as a "cheese curd" might I ask
<Cthulu>  radman - it's what you make cheese out of.  milk ages and separates
          into curds and whey.  (remember little miss muffet?)
<radman>  _Cthulu: yea I've ALWAYS wondered wtf curds and whey were
<Cthulu>  radman - drive up to oregon / washington and visit tilamook.
<Cthulu>  it's cheese country 8)
<Cthulu>  I should warn you all that I'm logging and capturing this for the
          next kithe cookbook 8)
<radman>  tna: I had something called italian poutine, they substituted
          the gravy with marinara
<radman>  heh
<radman>  wacky I tell you   
<radman>  Now I'm hungry
<radman>  for some congealed poutine
<tna>     radman: yeah, the italian poutine we have here is made with like,
          spaghetti sauce.       
<radman>  Generic Poutine: http://web.soi.city.ac.uk/pgg/article/Poutine
<Quip>    poutine is awesome
<Quip>    fuck that bullshit new york fries shit. burger king poutine rules
          all.
<radman>  I agree with Malcolm X.  If a Poutine shop were to be opened
          here, it would make millions.        
<radman>  How could a country like the U.S. not go hog wild for three
          fatty foods rolled into one snack.
<Cthulu>  radman - you'd have to give it a less ethnic name...
<Cthulu>  the US people think that french sounds snobbish.
<Cthulu>  you'll have to call them like "french nachos" or something.
<creator>  hehe   
<Cthulu>  nacho-fries.
<radman>  Cthulu: ahahah nacho fries

[Ed. in 2002 I took a cross-country Greyhound trip (styled "A Very Hairy
Charivari") and devoted my time in Quebec to trying to experience the real
poutine, a Platonic ideal only hand-waved from here on the west coast by
Burger King.  Everywhere trendy in Montreal tried to dazzle and impress the
sophisticated tourist with their brilliant new postmodern deconstructed 
interpretation of poutine, which in most places amounted to a species of
potato-vegetable cheese soup -- not bad, but if it's fancy it ain't poutine!
Even the renowned Patati Patata underwhelmed.  We had to go deep into the
working class industrial neighbourhood to find the real deal, concealing our
anglo nature in what amounted to a factory cafeteria, but damn, if you looked
the dish up in the dictionary it would have showed a picture of us dining
there.  Washed down with a bottle of spruce beer, cutting the grease with the
power of tree sap!

The second formidable poutine experience in Quebec occurred around 2 am at an
unscheduled bus stop at a Riviere-du-Loup resort, whose kitchen reactivated in
the middle of the night to keep a busload of travellers alive with a hot
nocturnal potato treatment sufficient to keep the passengers in enough
calories to make it to Charlottetown 7.5 hours away.  They didn't ask whether
you wanted poutine, and they didn't charge you, everyone simply filed out of
the bus in a fugue state by moonlight and was issued a hot serving of poutine.
Maybe there is language in Quebec legislation guaranteeing long-haul
passengers compassionate access to poutine on trips longer than ten hours.

The best poutine I found in all of Canada (and consequently, most likely the
world) came out of a chip wagon in Ottawa during civil service lunch hour.
Enough of our nation's capital runs on the throbbing brains of Quebecois
bureaucrats with residences across the river in Hull that they know from real
poutine and, with their cushy jobs, see no need to settle for an inferior
product... and yet, what restaurant can afford to pay rent on a full-time 
storefront that only serves one meal per day?  The chip wagon model provides.]

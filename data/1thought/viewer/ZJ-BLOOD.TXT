Official testimony has arrived from the Lab: my brother is malnourished. My 
middle-upper-middle class brother.

Apparently he is preanemic.  I, my sister, and my mother were all preanemic 
at his age, but it was then blamed on menstruation.  My mom says  "It must be 
a genetic predisposition. I wasn't malnourished! I ate lots and lots of red 
meat!"

I am feeling slightly smug about this, even though that's a really bitchy 
thing for me to do.  The kid doesn't eat vegetables (he claims he does... but 
we all know it's a lie...) or nuts -- nothing but crazy bread, salt and 
vinegar chips, lots of carbonated pop, and meat.  

He claims, "LIKE FUCK I'M FUCKING MALNOURISHED! I'M TALLER AND STRONGER THAN 
ALL OF YOU!!!"

He also has the attention span of a starling on crack and the pleasant 
disposition of a housecat I've been picking the scabs off for half an hour.  
On a good day.  

So my parents have recruited me, the amateur nutritionist, to get him whipped 
into shape over the holiday season. But the catch is: I'm not allowed to let 
him know that we're trying to change his diet, or the whole plan goes down 
the drain.  

I made vegetable-packed chicken vindaloo.  "It's too spicy." (though he ate 
the salad to compensate)

We bought sunflower seeds and kept offering them his way.  "I'm not hungry!!!"

This is going to be tough, particularly with my cholesterol-loving father and 
sugar/fat-binging mother setting good examples.  

And of course, he has a sort of private income and goes to the store to buy 
junk at least twice a day.  I think all that remains is setting him on the 
track of certain educated weightlifters and athletes who follow vegetable 
diets and convincing him that vegetables will make him buffer and manlier 
than Safeway brand chips. But fat chance that'll happen.

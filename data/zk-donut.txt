H> Bastards! There are no tim hortons in vancouver. 

We decided last night that although the pleasures of Tim Hortons are many,
the after effects (namely, marked sluggishness and bad dreams -- last night, 
full to the brim with timbits, I was forced to dance in a scum-filled
downtown eastside bar while little dutch toddlers wearing maniacal grins
manipulated their genitals alarmingly) are not worth it.  And plus, walking
through Loohead mall with those dorky little boxes puts one at risk of
having one's clock well and truly polished by the local wildlife.
